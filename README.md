# <Salena ONeill Potfolio>

## Description

My motivation for this project has been to build a potfolio website that I will add to to showcase my work to future emplyers once I build more applications. It was great practice using HTML and CSS.

## Usage

You can click on links in the navigation to scroll to the correspending section in my portfolio. Once I have applications to add, you will be able to click on those images to link you to my deployed application, but for now you click on the placeholder images and they take you to GitHub.
